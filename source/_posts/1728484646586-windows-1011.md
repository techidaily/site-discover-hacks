### Clone Hard Drive

You can directly clone hard drive to another one with the **[Disk Clone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/)** feature. If you are cloning HDD to SSD, you can make use of the "**SSD Alignment**" feature to improve the read/write speed of the destination SSD.

👉 **Notes:** 

* The free version of AOMEI Backupper only supports cloning a data disk. To clone a disk with OS installed, you can [upgrade](https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/) to higher versions to enjoy it.
* The [System Clone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/) feature can help you only clone system to new hard drive, which uses less disk space than disk clone. Also, it requires a higher version.
